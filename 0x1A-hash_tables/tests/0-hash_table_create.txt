#include <stdio.h>
#include "hash_tables.h"

int main(void)
{
    hash_table_t *hash_table;
    unsigned long int size = 10;

    hash_table = hash_table_create(size);

    if (hash_table == NULL)
    {
        printf("Failed to create hash table.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Hash table created successfully.\n");
    /* Additional tests or operations with the hash table */

    return 0;
}
```

In this test case, we create a hash table with a size of 10 using the `hash_table_create` function. We then check if the returned hash table pointer is `NULL`, indicating a failure in creating the hash table. If the pointer is not `NULL`, we assume that the hash table was created successfully and print a success message. You can add additional tests or operations with the hash table as needed for further verification.
